Client Request: When a user interacts with your platform, like logging in or accessing data, their request is sent to your server. This request comes with a special key called a JSON Web Token (JWT), like a secret passcode.

Middleware: The request first enters a checking point called Middleware. It's like a bouncer at a club. If the request is about logging in, it gets a quick pass. Otherwise, it moves on to the next step.

Database Resolver: Here comes the real magic. The Database Resolver looks at the JWT passcode and figures out which company (tenant) the user belongs to. It's like sorting mail to different mailboxes.

Database Connection: Once the Resolver knows which tenant it is, it opens the right door â€“ the tenant's database. It's as if each tenant has their own room in a huge library, and only they can access their own books.

Controller: With the right room (database) open, the Controller takes over. It's like a librarian who helps you find the book you need. The Controller figures out what the user wants to do and fetches the information from the correct room (database).

Services: Inside the Controller, special helpers called Services do the hard work. They carry out tasks like checking if the user's password is correct or fetching data. These Services are like expert librarians who know where every book is kept.

Database Interaction: The Services talk to the database, ask it questions, and get answers. For example, they might ask, "Is this the right password?" or "Give me the data for this user." Each tenant's data is kept separate, so there's no mix-up.

Response Generation: Once the Services have all the answers, they create a response. It's like putting together a report with all the necessary information, and it includes a message like "Success!" or "Sorry, that's not right."

Controller Response: The Controller gets this report and prepares it for delivery. It's like putting it in an envelope with the user's address on it.

Client Response: Finally, the response is sent back to the user's device. It's like getting the report in the mail. The user sees the message and any data they requested, and they can continue using your platform.
